Framework for Multi-commodity Energy Management in intelligent buildings.
Copyright (C) 2016

[Organic Smart Home](http://www.organicsmarthome.com) (OSH) is a free and open source energy management framework, which optimizes the energy provision, distribution, storage, conversion, and utilization in intelligent buildings, such as smart buildings and smart homes.

This framework was developed in response to the challenge of balancing supply and demand in the electric grid in spite of volatile, widely uncontrollable electrical power generation by means of renewable energy sources.

The building energy management system is based on the Extended Observer/Controller (O/C) architecture, which has been developed within the German priority research program on [Organic Computing](http://www.organic-computing.de) (DFG-Schwerpunktprogramm 1183).

It aims at realizing a mostly self-organizing and automated energy management system, reducing the need for interaction between the users (e.g., occupants) and the building's devices and systems (e.g., appliances, distributed generation, and building energy management system). However, the system still allows for explicit interference--if desired--and the users remain always in the loop.
